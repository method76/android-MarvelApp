<p>A Korean traditional board game 'Yut-nori' in collaboration with Marvel comics API.<br>
'Yut' is replaced by the dice with numbers from 1 to 5.</p>

<p>This is a competition game between 2 players. 3 or more players can be assigned,<br> but not recommend for so much collision among checkers.</p>
<p>Generally, checkers have to run around the circle(or square) on the board to return to start point.<br>
But, can return more faster if your checker stops at a beacon. It's the way points for the shortcuts<br>
The shortcut route of Yut-nori is like this.<br>

<p>* Additional rule</p>
<p>1) If a checker steps on the step opponent's occupying, The checker of the oopponent will be killed and should be returned to it's base.</p>
<p>And you'll also get one more chance of roll the dice.</p>
<p>2) If rolled dice show number 4, it means 'Yut', you'll get another change of roll the dice</p>
<p>3) But when you catch opponent's checker by 'Yut', you won't get another change of roll the dice</p>
